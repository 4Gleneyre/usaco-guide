## Explanation

Let's first focus on predicting the range of possible rates of traffic at the end of the highway (past mile N). To do this, we start with a large possible range $[a,b]$ (initially set to $[−999999999,+999999999]$) and narrow / modify it as we scan through the different highway components from miles 1…N. Every time we see a sensor reading directly from the highway, this clips the possible range $[a,b]$ to the range given by the sensor. Every time we see an on-ramp with range $[a′,b′]$, the new range of possible traffic flows is $[a+a′,b+b′]$. Similarly, when we see an off-ramp with range $[a′,b′]$, the new range of possible traffic flow values is $[a−b′,b−a′]$ (after this update, we set the lower end of the range to zero if it goes negative, since we can't have a negative rate of traffic flow).

Predicting the range of possible initial flows is similar and essentially symmetric, where we scan backwards and keep track of a working range $[a,b]$ that is narrowed / modified appropriately by each highway feature.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main(void)
{

// A stores lower bound of each range
// B stores upper bound of each range
// N stores the number of one-mile segments
    int N, A[100], B[100];

// T stores "none", "off", or "on" for each range
    string T[100];

    ifstream fin ("traffic.in");
    fin >> N;
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) fin >> T[i] >> A[i] >> B[i];

    ofstream fout ("traffic.out");

// Below is the initial range (a,b).  We will narrow/modify this range as we scan through
// the highway components from mile N to mile 1.  The resulting range will be the range of
// possible initial traffic flows.
    int a = -999999999, b = 999999999;

// Note that we are scanning backwards from mile N to mile 1 here.
    for (int i=N-1; i>=0; i--) {

        // if there is no ramp, the possible range (a,b) is narrowed to the range given by the sensor.
        if (T[i] == "none") { a = max(a, A[i]); b = min(b, B[i]); }

        // if there is an off-ramp with range (a',b'), the new range of possible traffic flows is (a+a',b+b')
        if (T[i] == "off") { a += A[i]; b += B[i]; }

        // if there is an on-ramp with range (a',b'), the new range of possible traffic flows is (a-b',b-a')
        if (T[i] == "on") { a -= B[i]; b -= A[i]; a = max(0,a); }
    }

    // Output the range of possible initial traffic flows.
    fout << a << " " << b << "\n";

// Below is the initial range (lo,hi).  We will narrow/modify this range as we scan through
// the highway components from mile 1 to mile N.  The resulting range will be the range of
// possible final traffic flows.
    a = -999999999, b = 999999999;
    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        // if there is no ramp, the possible range (a,b) is narrowed to the range given by the sensor.
        if (T[i] == "none") { a = max(a, A[i]); b = min(b, B[i]); }

        // if there is an on-ramp with range (a',b'), the new range of possible traffic flows is (a+a',b+b')
        if (T[i] == "on") { a += A[i]; b += B[i]; }

        // if there is an off-ramp with range (a',b'), the new range of possible traffic flows is (a-b',b-a')
        if (T[i] == "off") { a -= B[i]; b -= A[i]; a = max(0,a); }
    }
    fout << a << " " << b << "\n";

  return 0;
